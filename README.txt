Hello, this program keeps will help keep track with all the players you went against in various countries.

To use this program, click on the main.py file and the GUI will pop up.

Add a match and see the flag buttons enable.

To find your API key for osu, go to https://osu.ppy.sh/p/api to retrieve your API. For some reason, it takes about a minute for it to stop redirecting you to the forums. Refresh until it works. DO NOT SHARE YOUR API WITH ANYONE ELSE!

This is version .05 of this program. There will be more quality of life fixes such as sorting matches through pp, rank, date, etc. If a new version is available, move your .db file to the newer version to keep your data.

To-do:
	-"Matches Played" is a misnomer when you add teams of players, will change soon
	-Add a sorting in the flags
	-Can edit matches (if found mistake but don't want to delete)


Since this uses osu!'s API to fetch current data, it is currently not possible to type restricted players. I may loosen this in the future, but do you really want to add banned players into your list?
